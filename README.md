# 📚 TriAura Echoverse (Based on ebook2audiobook)

This project is **borrowed and adapted** from [ebook2audiobook](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/ebook2audiobook) by [DrewThomasson](https://github.com/DrewThomasson).  
All credits for the original implementation and features go to the ebook2audiobook developers. 🙌  

I have customized/extended the project under the name **TriAura Echoverse** for my own experiments and learning.
